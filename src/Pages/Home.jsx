        <h1>Applifi App</h1>
        <p>
          Applifi is an application that can copy any Spotify playlist to your
          Apple Music account. It uses <a href="https://odesli.co">Odesli</a>â€™s
          API to find the Apple Music versions of Spotify songs.
        </p>
        <h3>Spotify Access</h3>
        <p>
          This application requires access to an Spotify account. You only need
          to sign up for a free account to use the tool. All authentication is
          done on the client side only; data is not kept in any server or
          database.
        </p>
        <h3>Apple Music Access</h3>
        <p>
          This application requires access to your Apple Music account. Just
          like with the Spotify account, all authentication is done on the
          client side only; data is not kept in any server or database.
